## PORTFOLIO TRACKER

Has a single function. Calculating the potential gain/loss status of stocks within
transaction data given.

### Python Prototype To Test The Idea

The most basic implementation shows that the idea can work as intended.

### Project

The project is intended to be written in Rust. The only dependency should be the
cargo package for fetching the pricing data of stocks. It can be updated in the
future to remove the dependency.
